Apart from that you'll need the following software on your server (for deployment) or computer (for development).

* Python

* At this point you might want to create a virtual environment (developers should prefer virtualenvwrapper)
  * `virtualenv --distribute venv`
  * `source venv/bin/activate`
* `python setup.py develop`

Contiue here for production setup

* `pip install gunicorn`
* Change the `production.ini` file to your needs.
* `pserve --daemon production.ini`

## Notes for developers

### Submodule

There is a libs folder in `/profs/` which contains a git submodule with a reference to the python wrapper for the popit API. The original repository can be found on [github](https://github.com/domoritz/popit-python). So don't forget to init and update the submodule.

## Run the tests

	python setup.py nosetests
	
This command will also print the test coverage.
